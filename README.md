Just a simple todo that allows for tasks to have children using a simple tree model. 

TODO (heh) :


1. Write a search function that checks when a task is added, if any of the parents are marked completed. If they are, mark that false.
2. Clean up source code
3. Possibly add node support with secure random storage so the task can be saved for later.
